# Roblox Project: Cupola and NBL Experience

## 🌌 Description

This project aims to recreate two of the most iconic experiences of astronauts on the International Space Station (ISS):

* **The view from the Cupola**, offering a unique perspective of Earth from space.
* **Training in the Neutral Buoyancy Laboratory (NBL)**, where astronauts prepare underwater for space missions.

The goal is to provide students and the general public with a visual and interactive tool that allows them to understand how these sensory experiences (sight and weightlessness) benefit humanity on Earth.

## 🎯 Objectives

* Educate and entertain through an immersive environment created in **Roblox Studio**.
* Showcase how space exploration contributes to science and life on Earth.
* Allow users to interact with the experience both in the Cupola and in the NBL.

## 🕹️ Main Features

### 🛰️ Cupola Experience

* The user can **create and customize a basic character**.
* The character is placed inside the Cupola, observing Earth.
* The player can **select geographic regions** and view real ISS images.
* **Scientific and cultural information** is displayed for each region.

### 🌊 NBL Experience

* The user can **simulate underwater astronaut training**.

* A **weight and buoyancy adjustment system** enables a weightless state.

* Interactive mini-games:

  * Entering and exiting airlocks.
  * Performing simulated repairs.
  * Moving along handrails and station structures.

* **Simulated lunar exploration**: the user can descend to the bottom of the tank and perform tasks such as collecting samples or using tools.

## 👥 Target Audience

* Students of different levels.
* General public interested in science, space exploration, and education.
* Educational events and museums seeking interactive and visual experiences.

## 📊 Resources Used

* **Roblox Studio** as the creation engine.
* NASA images and data (Cupola, ISS, and NBL).
* Custom 3D models to simulate space structures.

## 🚀 Potential Uses

* STEM education in schools and universities.
* Science and technology museums.
* Science outreach events.
* Online interactive experiences.

## 💡 Future Considerations

* Optimization for touchscreens and mobile devices.
* Inclusion of virtual reality for greater immersion.
* Expansion of mini-games and interactive experiences.
